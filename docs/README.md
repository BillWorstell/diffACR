## Overview

diffACR is an open-source project aimed at supporting ACR Phantom tests using differentiable forward projections and pose estimation techniques. This project leverages `diffDRR` and `diffPose` from MIT CSAIL and is organized in their style.

## Features

- Differentiable forward projections
- Pose estimation
- ACR Phantom test support
- Integration with PyTorch for machine learning applications
- Tutorials in Jupyter Notebooks
